# Installing mql-compiler

`mql-compiler` is one file on `PATH` that runs the `psyb0t/mql-compiler` Docker image. The prerequisites are an x86-64 (amd64) machine, since there is no ARM image, and a running Docker daemon the user can talk to (`docker info` works without sudo).

## Install

Per user, into `~/.local/bin`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/psyb0t/docker-mql-compiler/master/install.sh | bash
```

System wide, into `/usr/local/bin`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/psyb0t/docker-mql-compiler/master/install.sh | sudo bash -s -- --system
```

| Option | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--user` | Install to `~/.local/bin` (the default when not root) |
| `--system` | Install to `/usr/local/bin` (the default as root; needs root) |
| `--rolling` | Pin `psyb0t/mql-compiler:latest` instead of the newest release tag |
| `--uninstall` | Remove the command and the image it was pinned to; the toolchain volume stays |

The installer pins the newest GitHub release tag, pulls it, and writes the pin into the command file. There is no config folder. It refuses to overwrite a file at the target path that it did not install. A per-user install warns when `~/.local/bin` is not on `PATH` and prints the line to add to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`.

## Upgrade

Run the same install command again. It pins the newest release and removes the image it replaced.

The MT4 and MT5 toolchain in the cache does not change with the image: it stays on the MetaEditor builds installed on the first run. `mql-compiler --version` shows them, and `mql-compiler --update` reinstalls both from the newest installers (about a minute and a half). If the reinstall fails, the previous toolchain is put back.

## First run

The first compile downloads the MT4 and MT5 installers, checks their signatures (valid digest, a trusted certificate chain, a signing certificate whose common name starts with `MetaQuotes`), and installs both into the `mql-compiler-cache` Docker volume. The installers leave the standard library packed, so setup then starts each terminal once, headless, until it has unpacked its `MQL4`/`MQL5` folder, stops it, and moves the terminal to a portable folder in the volume (`terminals/mt4`, `terminals/mt5`). A cache made by an older version gets that move on its next run, without downloading anything. All of it takes about a minute and a half and about 2 GB of disk. `mql-compiler --setup` does only this, which is handy before a timed job. Later runs reuse the volume and take seconds.

A compile installs only the platforms its sources need: a run of only `.mq5` files installs MT5 alone, and MT4 follows the first time a `.mq4` shows up. A platform given a portable terminal with `--mt4-terminal`/`--mt5-terminal` is never downloaded; the run uses that terminal's MetaEditor and standard library, mounted read-only, and only creates the Wine prefix.

To use another broker's installers, set `MQL_COMPILER_MT4_URL` and `MQL_COMPILER_MT5_URL` together with a new `MQL_COMPILER_VOLUME` name, and keep that volume name for later runs. Removing `mql-compiler-cache` instead works too, but it deletes every user's toolchain on the machine.

## Uninstall

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/psyb0t/docker-mql-compiler/master/install.sh | bash -s -- --uninstall
docker volume rm mql-compiler-cache   # also frees the toolchain, for every user on the machine
```

The uninstaller removes the command and the image it was pinned to (it warns and keeps the image if a container still uses it). Use `sudo ... --system --uninstall` for a system-wide install.

## Checks

```bash
command -v mql-compiler        # installed and on PATH
mql-compiler --version         # the image runs; shows its version and the MetaEditor builds (null before the first run)
docker volume ls | grep mql-compiler-cache   # toolchain cached (after the first run)
docker run --rm -v mql-compiler-cache:/c busybox cat /c/uid-$(id -u)/logs/last-run.log   # the last run's full output
```

## Troubleshooting

- **`docker is not installed`**: Docker's CLI is not on `PATH`.
- **`cannot talk to Docker`** (installer) or an exit status of `125`: the daemon is down, the user is not in the `docker` group, or the image could not be pulled. On an ARM machine the pull fails with "no matching manifest".
- **`toolchain setup failed`**: the installer download or its signature check failed, the install finished without a MetaEditor, or the terminal did not unpack its standard library. The stderr log lines just before it say which. Retry; a custom installer URL must point at a MetaQuotes-signed setup file.
- **`toolchain update failed`**: `--update` could not reinstall; the previous toolchain is back in place. The log lines before it say why.
- **`the terminal did not unpack its standard library`** (log line): the terminal started but never wrote its headers within two minutes. Run `mql-compiler --setup` again; if it keeps failing, run `mql-compiler --update`.
- **`... belongs to UID N, not M: the cache was written by another UID`**: that cache folder was created by a different user ID inside the same volume. Run as the original user, or use your own `MQL_COMPILER_VOLUME`.
- **`no such file or folder`**: the path does not exist (relative paths start at the current folder).
- **`refusing to mount / into the container`**: `mql-compiler` ran with no path from `/`, or a loose file sits directly in `/`. Name the folders or files to compile.
- **`another mql-compiler run is using this cache, waiting for it to finish`**: not an error. Another run for the same user is going; this one starts when it ends.
- **`not an .mq4 or .mq5 file`**: a header or other file was named directly; name the `.mq4`/`.mq5` that includes it.
- **`no .mq4 or .mq5 files found`**: the folders given hold no sources (symlinked sources inside a folder are skipped).
- **`MetaEditor wrote no result`** (a `failed` record with `errors: null` and a `log` field): MetaEditor crashed or never ran for that file. `log` holds whatever it wrote; run again, and run `mql-compiler --update` if it repeats.
- **`no such include folder`** / **`-I needs a folder`**: an `-I` path is missing or does not exist.
- **`file '...' not found` for a custom header**: the source is not under the `MQL4`/`MQL5` folder whose `Include` holds that header, or the include climbs out of the mounted folder.
- **Permission errors on every file on an SELinux host**: the mounts carry no `:z` label; relabel the source folders or run the image by hand with `:z` mounts.
